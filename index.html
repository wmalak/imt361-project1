        The About Page is the home page of this website. It 
        contains relevant information about the web pages, as well 
        as information related to learning HTML and creating your
        own GitHub web page.

        From personal experience, one of my favorite resources when learning anything 
        related to coding is <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/"><strong>GeeksforGeeks</strong></a>.
        They are a reliable source of information and explanations about many different topics 
        that are relevant to CS and ITM students. The link above is to a page that can introduce 
        those unfamiliar with using HTML to the concept.

  <h4>
    Make your own Web Page
  </h4> 
  <p id="home_text">
    One of the best ways to get into creating websites is to create your 
    first webpage. One of the best resources to do so is using <a href="https://github.com/"><strong>GitHub</strong></a>. 
    GitHub is a platform for keeping an organized repository of code for any project. It can be a bit difficult 
    to use when you are new to the tool, so it is good to look at tutorials like the 
    <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo"> <strong>guide to create a repository</strong></a> and 
    <a href="https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-make-your-site-live-on-github-pages"><strong>how to create a live website page</strong></a>. 
    It is also possible, and sometimes preferential, to find a video that demonstrates how to do these things, like the following video:

    <p> Welcome to the bottom of my page, where there sits a whole lotta nothing. Then again, this is technically something. A conundrum for sure.</p>
